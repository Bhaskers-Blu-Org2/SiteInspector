    <td>SiteInspector.js is a framework for a lightweight pane that slides out from the side of your browser 
window and can be used to enhance any web site or portal with additional, contextual content. Use it
to display usage statistics, expose diagnostic tools, show performance analytics, or any other useful 
information to help you manage and maintain your site.</td>

# Getting started

To try out this example, clone the project and install [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli) if you don't have it already.


```sh
npm run demo-install
npm run demo-start
```

This will launch a test server (http://localhost:3000) with an example of the SiteInspector.JS shell embedded in the page. The small Microsoft logo tab on the left of the page can be clicked to slide out the blade framework as shown on the right.
